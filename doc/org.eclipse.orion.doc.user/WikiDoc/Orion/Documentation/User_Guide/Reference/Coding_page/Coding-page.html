		<p>Navigate to the <b>Coding</b> page by clicking any file in the 
			<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Navigator_page/Navigator-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User_Guide/Reference/Navigator_page">Navigator page</a> that has a corresponding Orion editor. This page is comprised mainly of an editor area, and a collapsible outline section on the left hand side. Click a function or field name in the outline to scroll the editor to that declaration. Error markers are shown in the gutter to the left of the line numbers, and a birds-eye view of errors is shown next to the scroll bar on the right. The name of the file being edited, and the current line and column information are shown in the title area at the top of the page.
