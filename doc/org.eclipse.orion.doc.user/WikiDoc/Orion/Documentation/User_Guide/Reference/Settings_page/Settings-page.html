		<p>The '
			<i>Settings '</i> page allows you to view and change the plugins that you have installed. Some plugins are already installed by default, and if you attempt to uninstall them they will be added back automatically. If you are a plugin developer, you can also use this page to browse through the services and properties of installed plugins. 
		</p>
		<p>The plugins list is accessed from the settings page - accessed by clicking on the drop down menu under your username in the top right hand corner of the Orion application.

		</p>
		<p>To install a plugin, click the&nbsp;'
			<i>Install '</i>link at the top left hand corner of the page, where a dialog will be presented to allow you to enter in the URL address of a plugin. Beside that link is a link to reload all the current plugins - sometimes useful for restablishing default setups. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>Each plugin entry can be individually reloaded by pressing the curved arrow icon beside the plugin information, and each can be individually removed. </p>
		<p>Beneath each plugin entry is a services link. Clicking on that link expands an area to reveal a carousel of service tables: </p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<img width="500" border="0" src="images/Carousel.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>
			<br/> 
		</p>
		<p>For plugins with multiple services, the carousel can be used to scroll through them from left to right of the screen. If you are debugging, and a service entry offers 'JavaScript Object' as a value for an item, clicking on that value will open the object up for further traversal in the console window of WebKit and Mozilla browsers.&nbsp;</p>
