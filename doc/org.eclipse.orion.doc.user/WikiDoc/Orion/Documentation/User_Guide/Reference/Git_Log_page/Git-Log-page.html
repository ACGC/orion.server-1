		<h1 id="Git_Log_page">Git Log page</h1>
		<p>The <b>Git Log</b> page allows you to browse the commit history of a Git repository branch. The page can show all the commits on a given branch, or focus on only the commits that involve changes to a particular file or directory. You can browse both local and remote branches using this page.  What you see in this page depends on how you navigated to it.</p>
		<h2 id="Opening_the_Git_Log_page">Opening the Git Log page</h2>
		<p>There are many ways to open the Git Log page:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Choose a file or directory in the 
				<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Navigator_page/Navigator-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User Guide/Reference/Navigator page">Navigator page</a>, and select <b>Git Log</b> in the <b>Actions</b> column. This will show all commits in your current local branch that involve changes to the chosen file or directory.
			</li>
			<li>Choose a file or directory in the 
				<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Navigator_page/Navigator-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User Guide/Reference/Navigator page">Navigator page</a>, and select <b>Git Remote</b> in the <b>Actions</b> column. This will show all commits in the current remote tracking branch that involve changes to the chosen file or directory.
			</li>
			<li>From the 
				<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Git_Status_page/Git-Status-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User Guide/Reference/Git Status page">Git Status page</a>, click the <b>Complete log</b> link next to either the local or remote tracking branch. This will open the complete log for either of those branches.
			</li>
			<li>From the 
				<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Repositories_page/Repositories-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User Guide/Reference/Repositories page">Repositories page</a>, click <b>Show Git Log</b> in the <b>Actions</b> column next to any local or remote branch of a repository. This will show the entire commit history of the corresponding branch.
			</li>
			<li>From the <b>Git Log</b> page itself, there are <b>Switch to Remote</b> or <b>Switch to Local</b> links in the toolbar to navigate between the logs of local and remote tracking branches.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Operations_from_the_Git_Log_page">Operations from the Git Log page</h2>
		<p>Once on the Git Log page, you will see a list of commits in chronological order. The title area lets you know what branch and file or directory the page is focused on. In the example below, we are viewing the local branch called <b>master</b> in the repository called <b>Orion Client</b>.</p>

		</p>
		<p>If you are viewing a local branch that is not up to date with its remote tracking branch, a <b>Push All</b> command is available in the toolbar to push your unreleased changes. When viewing a remote branch, <b>Fetch</b> and <b>Merge</b> commands are available in the toolbar to bring remote changes into your local repository and working copy.</p>
		<p>Click any commit in the list to open a pane showing detailed information about the commit. This pane includes author information, the commit message, and the SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies that commit in the Git repository. The pane also shows a list of all files that had changes in that commit. Click the command icon next to any file in that pane to open a compare viewer showing the differences in that file. The area where commands appear is highlighted in the image below.</p>

		<h2 id="Git_Log_for_single_files">Git Log for single files</h2>
		<p>When viewing the Git log for a single file, some additional capabilities are available. First, the breadcrumb in the title area allows you to navigate to the Git log list for any parent of the currently viewed file. Additional commands are also available in the <b>Actions</b> column. The <b>Open</b> link will open the revision of the current file as it appeared in that commit. You can also compare the contents of that commit to the current contents of that file in your working tree. Finally, if you select any two files, a <b>Compare With Each Other</b> command appears in the toolbar, to compare the differences in that file between the selected commits.</p>
