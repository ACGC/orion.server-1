		<h1 id="Navigator_page">Navigator page</h1>
		<p>The <b>Navigator</b> page is your primary location for browsing and manipulating files in Orion. The page can be focused on any folder, including the root folder associated with each Orion user. The current folder being displayed is shown below the word <b>Navigator</b> in the title area, with a breadcrumb showing the complete path to the folder. You can browse through a directory hierarchy either by clicking on a folder to open a Navigator page on that folder, or by expanding the tree to show children in the same page. You can navigate upwards by clicking a path in the breadcrumb, or by clicking <b>Go Up</b> (Alt+Up on the keyboard). Clicking a file will open a page for that file.  For source code files (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), clicking on a file will open the 
			<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Coding_page/Coding-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User_Guide/Reference/Coding_page">Coding page</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Commands for operating on files in the Navigator appear in several places, depending on what files and folders they are operating upon. Commands that operate directly on the root folder of Navigator are displayed in the tool bar. Commands that operate on individual files and folders in the list appear in the drop-down menu next to that file or folder. Commands that operate on the files selected in the table are shown in the <b>More</b> menu in the tool bar.</p>

		<h2 id="Copying_and_moving_folders_and_files">Copying and moving folders and files</h2>
		<p>There are two methods available for copying files in Orion. The first method uses the clipboard:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Type Ctrl+Shift+F to search for a file with a given name. Clicking a match will open a page for the file as if you had clicked it in the Navigator folder list.  (In many cases, this opens the 
				<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Coding_page/Coding-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User_Guide/Reference/Coding_page">Coding page</a> on that file.) If there is only a single match, simply press 'Enter' to open that file.
			</li>
			<li>Typing search terms in the search box in the upper right corner of the title area will search for the terms across all files in the folder you are viewing. Matches will be displayed in the 
				<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Search_Results_page/Search-Results-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User_Guide/Reference/Search_Results_page">Search Results page</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A global search and replace can be performed by first running a search from the search box, and then supplying a replace term in the 
			<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Search_Results_page/Search-Results-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User_Guide/Reference/Search_Results_page">Search Results page</a>.

Click <b>Make Favorite</b> in the <b>Actions</b> column to add any file or folder as a favorite. You can also save any web site address as a favorite by clicking the <b>Add Favorite</b> icon within the Favorites panel. Search results can also be marked as favorites from the 
			<a href="../../../../../\Orion\Documentation\User_Guide\Reference\Search_Results_page/Search-Results-page.html" title="Orion/Documentation/User_Guide/Reference/Search_Results_page">Search Results page</a>. Current favorites can be renamed and deleted by clicking the command icons that appear when hovering over any favorite in your list.
